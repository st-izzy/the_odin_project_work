    <p>This is a wonderful pineapple dish to be served with ham. It is <br>
        a favorite at Easter in my family. The egg whites add a touch <br>
        of lightness to it.</p>

    <p>Total Time: 50 min | Servings: 12</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 eggs, whites and yolks separated</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup butter</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can crushed pineapple, drained</li>
        <li>3 cups cubed bread</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Beat egg whites until foamy in a large glass or metal <br>
            mixing bowl until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or <br>
            whisk straight up: the egg whites should form a sharp <br>
            peak that holds its shape. </li>
        <li>Beat the egg yolks, sugar, butter, and milk together in <br>
            a large bowl. Stir in the pineapple and bread. Lightly <br>
            fold egg whites into the pineapple mixture, then spread <br>
            the mixture into a large baking dish. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 35 to 45 minutes. </li>
    </ol>
