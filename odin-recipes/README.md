# Project: Recipes

This is my third TOP project where I create a simple recipe site.

---

## Assignment

Create multiple HTML pages that link to each other.
The pages are recipes pulled from allrecipes.com.
The project is intended to be pushed to github for demonstration.

In my case, this project is being held in a repo that keeps all of my TOP work.

## Skills

This is practice with the elements already learned in previous lessons:

- head and body
- headings
- paragraphs
- lists (ordered and unordered)
- anchor links
- images

This assignment also introduces the idea of pages linking to each other using `a` anchors.
I spent some extra time including links to the original recipes in the recipe pictures.
There's also a "Home" link at the top of each recipe page that sends the user back to the index page.

In order to make this project accessible, I've also created a link page at the root of this portfolio repository that leads to each project.
